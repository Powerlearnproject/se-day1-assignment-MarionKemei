#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   It is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software .It involves application of engineering principles, methods  and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systens.
    
  **Importance of Software Engineering**: It enables creation of software applications that powers modern life in all aspects. Generally, it drives innovation, ensures reliablility, security and  supports the global community.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  1. Birth of Software engineering: In !968, Software Engineering was introduced during the NATO Software Engineering Conference.The need of a more structured and systemic approach to software development was highlighted, moving away ad-hoc methods that were then prevalent. This marked the beginning of software engineering as a recognized discipline.
  2. Introduction of OOP.In 1980s, there was rise of Object Oriented Programming, which revolutionized how software was designed and developed.OOP introduced concepts like classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which made software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
  3. Emergence of Agile Methodologies.
     Agile methods was introduced in the 1990s as a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid software development models like Waterfall.  Agile was formally defined with the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which emphasized collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability over rigid processes.Agile methodologies transformed software engineering by promoting continuous delivery, adaptive planning, and flexibility. This approach became the foundation for modern development practices such as Scrum and DevOps, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver higher-quality software more efficiently.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning
   The project scope, objectives and feasibility are defined.It includes gathering requirements, estimating costs, and creating a project plan to guide the development process.
   
2. Requirements analysis
   Detailed requirements are gathered here, and analyzed to understand what the software needs to achieve. This involves working closely with stakeholders to document functional and non-functional requirements.
   
3. Design
    It involves architectural design, detailed design of components, and creating data models and user interfaces.
   
4. Implementation
   During implementation, the actual code is written based on the design documents. Developers create the software components, integrate them, and ensure they function as intended.
   
5. Testing
   involves verifying that the software works correctly and meets the specified requirements. This phase includes various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
   
6. Deployment
   This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training after the software is deemed ready and deployed to the priduction environment.
   
7. Maintenance
    Here, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues and updated as needed. This includes fixing bugs, making improvements, and adding new features based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development whereas Agile is an iterative and incremental approach.
  i. Agile is more flexible and adaptive to changes, while Waterfall is rigid.
  ii. Waterfall emphasizes thorough documentation, whereas Agile focuses on working software and minimal documentation.
  iii. Agile involves continuous customer feedback, while Waterfall typically involves the customer mainly at the beginning and end of the project.
  iv. Agile mitigates risks by delivering small increments, while Waterfall may face higher risks due to its linear nature.
  
  **Example Scenarios**
  1. Waterfall. 
      suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change. For instance, developing software for a regulatory compliance system where the requirements are clear and fixed.I.e Regulatory projects( healthcare and finace), Hardware intergration projects.
  2. Agile.
      Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve. For example, developing a new mobile app where user feedback is crucial for ongoing improvements.
